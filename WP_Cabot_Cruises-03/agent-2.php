                <p class="agent-p">It is often said “To learn of the person is to know the person”…so let me begin my
                    story… I have been a part of the travel industry for more than 25 years; working as an independent
                    and as a full time agent in the retail travel industry. I’ve also worked many years with United
                    Airlines.

                    I can speak of personal travel experiences gleaning from many trips the world over, including the
                    Continental USA, Alaska and Hawaii. I have organized groups for corporate and convention travel.
                    Destination weddings, family reunions have become an important place in my portfolio.

                    Many people today have a “bucket list” which hold a list of dream vacations such as Hawaii, Europe
                    and other far off exotic places. I can help with all of these plans by putting together Independent
                    Flexible Travel itineraries. Hawaii holds particular interest to me as it is there I frequently
                    visit my family and friends.

                    My loyal clients speak with praise and satisfaction for the memories they cherish on the vacation
                    trips we planned together. It would be my pleasure to offer my services and help with your special
                    vacation planning and events.</p>
