# UNIT03 WORDPRESS TEMPLATE(10 PTS)
Create a new folder under your 3740 sub-domain called WordPress. Install a clean copy of WordPress in this folder. Do not use an auto installer from your web hosting company.

Using the responsive template from assignment 1, create a WordPress theme for WordPress. Your WordPress site and new custom theme should meet the criteria listed below.

You will be using a CSS preprocessor to reduce the number of HTTP requests made by your page. It’s all about speed!

Using a CSS Framework will automatically fail this assignment.

## Site Template
Use the template you built in the previous assignment. The responsive site should work on phone, tablet, and desktop.

[x] - Phone will use drop down menus as shown in my GitHub account.
[x] - Phone menu will show "MENU" with hamburger icon to the side
[x] - Tablet will properly display two deep navigation considering there is no hover state
[x] - Any main menu with sub menus will link to the main menu item to # (think stupid android phones)
[x] - Desktop with sucker-fish drop-down menus
[x] - Active Menu item will be highlighted properly. WordPress will provide the class and you will style it
[x] - Use a CSS preprocessor so you can combine your style sheets into a single HTTP request

Your header will contain the following items:

[x] - Company Icon, Name, and Slogan
[x] - Search box with placeholder = "search…"
