                <p class="agent-p">"Lacey sure knows the ins and outs of travel! She ended up talking us out of our original plans and I'm so glad that she did. The sights that she recommended and the places we ate added a whole new experience to our time in Africa."</p>

                <p class="agent-p">"I've never used a Travel Agent, but now I know what all the Hype is about. I feel like I got the ultimate vacation package with all the secret hacks you usually have to spend hours researching, but Lacey just knew because she has experienced them first hand as well as recieved and stored reccommendations from past clients. Bravo!"</p>
