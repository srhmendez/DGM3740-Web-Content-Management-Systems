# DGM3740 Web Content Management Systems

This repository features projects 1-10 &amp; a Capstone Project for DGM 3740 taken at UVU in 2021 Spring Semester. The course focuses on taking everything I have learned previously about design, markup, and JavaScript and putting it together to build a customer site in WordPress using a hand-built theme. Each project is listed in this repository and by clicking on each individual project folder. Each project folder contains a ReadME.md file with a brief description and a link to deploy the website.

### Technologies Used:

- JavaScript ES6
- CSS3
- HTML5
