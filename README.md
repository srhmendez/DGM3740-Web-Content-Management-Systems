# Web Content Management Systems

This repository features projects 1-10 & a Capstone Project for DGM 3740 taken at UVU in 2021 Spring Semester. The course focuses on taking everything  I have learned previously about design, markup, and JavaScript and putting it together to build a customer site in WordPress using a hand-built theme. Each project is listed in this repository and by clicking the subfolders, you will be able to link to the individual projects through their README.md files.
