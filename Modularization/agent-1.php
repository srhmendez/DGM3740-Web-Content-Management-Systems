            <p class="agent-p">Through his work and own extensive travel, Juan has made excellent contacts with overseas
                tour operators in most parts of the world. He has visited over 100 countries, including excursions into
                the Amazon and Mekong Rivers, elephant riding and visiting tribal villages in Thailand, Myanmar, Laos
                and Cambodia, and has enjoyed African safaris and trips to the Galapagos Islands. Juan has also cruised
                aboard more than 80 ships, and has travelled extensively throughout Europe, South America and North
                America.

                As a Cabot Cruise consultant, Juan specializes in luxury travel, particularly to Southeast Asia and Europe,
                which he has visited more than 20 times each. His private, customized tours to Asia, Europe, South
                America and Costa Rica, as well as his 30 years of experience with international corporate travel, have
                earned him a fan following. He has served as a travel arranger to the stars, helping many celebrities
                and company officers plan seamless trips abroad. Juan's clients appreciate his commitment to
                confidentiality and his ability to tailor travel plans to fit all their needs.</p>
